# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: November 4, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started Udacity Front End Development Course and restarted freeCodeCamp Resposive Web Developement Certificate. Got all the way to Flexbox lessons. I also did two days of 30 Days of Code on HackerRank. 

**Thoughts:** I was able to fly through the HTML lessons and the beginning CSS lessons on Udacity and freeCodeCamp. HackerRank was harder than I thought for the easy ones because I have no real JavaScript experience. I worked in Java which I have a small knowledge of. 


### Day 1: November 5, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I went through all the Flexbox lessons on freeCodeCamp and the CSS lesson in Udacity. Going to go for the Flexbox lessons with notes before bed. 

**Thoughts** I have never learned Flexbox before and will probably need more in depth lessons on it and some hands on. Will check blog articles and plan it into future projects to start soon.
